# Examining-COVID-19-Vaccination-Rates-in-California
This group project was completed during the 2021 Datathon for Social Good put on by UC Berkeley Data Science Society and Net Impact @ Berkeley. Our group decided to analyze COVID-19 vaccination rates among different race/ethnicity demographics in California, testing for statistically significant differences using A/B testing. We also used linear regression to plot the relationship between vaccination rates and median income per county and created a model that could predict the vaccination rate of a county given its median income. This project was awarded third prize in the general division.
