The Deepnote and slidedeck for this project can be accessed in the uploaded files section.

This group project was completed during the 2021 Datathon for Social Good put on by UC Berkeley Data Science Society. Our group decided to analyze COVID-19 vaccination rates among different race/ethnicity demographics in California, testing for statistically significant differences using A/B testing. We also used linear regression to plot the relationship between vaccination rates and median income per county and created a model that could predict the vaccination rate of a county given its median income.
