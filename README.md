# Examining-COVID-19-Vaccination-Rates-in-California
This group project was awarded third prize in the general division of the 2021 Datathon for Social Good put on by UC Berkeley Data Science Society and Net Impact @ Berkeley. Our group decided to analyze COVID-19 vaccination rates among different race/ethnicity demographics in California, testing for statistically significant differences using A/B testing. We also used linear regression to plot the relationship between vaccination rates and median income per county and created a model that could predict the vaccination rate of a county given its median income. Vaccine data was retrieved from the California Department of Public Health and income data was taken from the California Government website. Python packages used include pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and datascience from UC Berkeley's Data 8 course.
