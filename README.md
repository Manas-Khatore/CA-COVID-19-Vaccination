# Examining-COVID-19-Vaccination-Rates-in-California
This group project was awarded third prize in the general division of the 2021 Datathon for Social Good put on by UC Berkeley Data Science Society and Net Impact @ Berkeley. The main goals of this project were to:
- Analyze COVID-19 vaccination rates among different race/ethnicity demographics in California, testing for statistically significant differences using A/B testing
- Use linear regression to plot the relationship between vaccination rates and median income per county
- Create a model that could predict the vaccination rate of a county given its median income.

Vaccine data was retrieved from the California Department of Public Health and income data was taken from the California Government website. 

Tools used include:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- datascience module from UC Berkeley's Data 8 course (syntactically similar to pandas)
